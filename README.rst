Dead simple frontend template with Grunt autoreload, bower and scss.

Installation
============

If you haven't already done so, install grunt-init.

.. code:: shell

  sudo npm install -g grunt-init

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

.. code:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/chuwy/grunt-init-frontend.git ~/.grunt-init/frontend


Usage
=====

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

.. code:: shell
 
  grunt-init frontend

Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files.
